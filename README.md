# Python Concurrency Examples

This repository contains examples of how to use Python's built-in concurrency features such as multi-threading, and multi-processing. Each example is a self-contained script that demonstrates a specific use case where we test out the performance of multi-threading and multi-processing. Tracing is done via [VizTracer](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html) and visualized using VizViewer.
